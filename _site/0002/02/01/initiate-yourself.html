<p><br /></p>

<p>When I was a little child, my grandmother was frightened by a rather exquisite behavior I had: a repetitive obsession with certain numbers, colors, smells, sounds and symbols.</p>

<p>For example, for some reason, I would always have to turn on the lights seven times.</p>

<p>As a Catholic madam, she suggested to my mother a consultation with a psychiatrist or an exorcist. She didn’t know if it was OCD, autism or a “demonic possession”.</p>

<p>Thankfully, my mother, her daughter-in-law, simply ignored her and provided meaning to my “exquisite” obsessions as a pagan herself. I was taught what those numbers meant, why I was so fearful of some of them, and with a very basic knowledge I gradually started to see more and more of a “subtle” reality that’s simply invisible to those without innocent eyes.</p>

<p>As an adult, I can now analyze those unexplainable and “irrational” obsessions as attempts to involuntarily “initiate myself”. And if you have Aryan blood, even if partially, it’s likely you’ll experience something like this. If that never happened, you’re probably silencing yourself with a decadent life and cosmovision, blinding yourself to this beautiful taciturn parrot.</p>

<p>It happens with strange coincidences, “synchronicities”, strange visions and dreams, “irrational fears” and even panic attacks at times.</p>

<p>Your spirit seeks the gradual unfolding of these subtler and deeper realms, and it may give you all the keys you need to open all these doors.</p>

<p>Many “professional” “experts” and “gurus” in esotericism will tell you about how you can only be initiated by someone who’s been previously initiated.</p>

<p>Rene Guenon is probably the most famous example of this and he’s right.</p>

<p>At least for the religion he ended up following… Islam.</p>

<p>A religion that, as any that follows from Judaism, “denaturalize all natural values”.</p>

<p>There’s no better explanation of this than this Nietzsche’s quote:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The Jews are the most remarkable people in the history of the world, for when they were confronted with the question, to be or not to be, they chose, with perfectly unearthly deliberation, to be at any price: this price involved a radical falsification of all nature, of all naturalness, of all reality, of the whole inner world, as well as of the outer. They put themselves against all those conditions under which, hitherto, a people had been able to live, or had even been permitted to live; out of themselves they evolved an idea which stood in direct opposition to natural conditions—one by one they distorted religion, civilization, morality, history and psychology until each became a contradiction of its natural significance.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(The Anti-Christ)</p>

<p>Hence, the so-called secrets of the Kabbalah, cherished by Guenon and other Abrahamic “traditionalists” and occultists, in its deception and anti-natural substratum, will never be acquired as a direct by-product of a naturally lived experience.</p>

<p>Their so-called “initiations”, surrounded by pretentious rites and robes, are simply human creations. 
They need you to believe in its importance: the power behind these secret society resides in the submission of each member.</p>

<p>They will convince you that their esoteric truths are so “special and life-changing”, you may give everything you have to get a tiny little flake of it.</p>

<p>You may give them a substantial amount of money.</p>

<p>You may give them your anus (literally).</p>

<p>You may give them your wife (it actually happens).</p>

<p>You may give them… your little daughter…</p>

<p>But you will never be free or have that warm tenderness in your heart that’s only acquired as a gift by being part of the living tradition that belonged to your forebears.</p>

<p>Their Kabbalistic decadence must be “passed” from an initiate to another because nature itself would transmit filth to you through these subtler realms.</p>

<p>It’d be counterproductive.</p>

<p>Why would nature teach you the tools to destroy her?</p>

<p>Nature directly transmits the deeper and pure realms that are already written in our blood to give us an important role: amalgamate its own beauty.</p>

<p>The voices, sounds and signs of nature when presented to you are not only an invitation to initiate yourself but a call for you to be part of your own blood.</p>

<p>With a few hints and books, you’ll slowly see and understand many secrets of the universe. They will be directly given to you if you learn to respect yourself, your blood and the rules of the universe.</p>

<p>Having a friend or a parent to help you decipher your own experiences is surely helpful but, if that’s not available, may your heart be your only and most valuable guide.</p>

<p>Sharpen your intuition and your teachers may present themselves to you. Out of nowhere, they will find you, and you will find them.</p>

<p>The fact that you’re reading this after finding some rather obscure posts in an online forum may be one of these coincidences.</p>

<p>Why did I post at the time you were there?</p>

<p>Why were you visiting that place in that moment?</p>

<p>Why didn’t you ignore me?</p>

<p>Why did you read this entire post?</p>

<p>If you’ve never seen a sign from nature, maybe, just maybe, the fact you encountered this text may be your first.</p>
